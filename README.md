# Film_Recommendation_Using_Kmeans

#Purpose
- To apply k-means clustering, an algorithm I have learnt in Linear Algebra class and use it to create a simple movie recommendation system
- I only use two main factors for this simple system: users' ratings of movies and movies' genres.
- The dataset being used is Movielens. It is a commonly used dataset in the field of recommender systems and machine learning 

# To Run The Project

- Go to "film-main.py" 
- Run the file

# Explaining what you will see
- The first graph is the "elbow method" used for determining optimal number of clusters
- After deleting the first graph, the second graph shows how favorite movies are clustered based on their genres
- After that you will need to type in a user id based on the user id data in order to receive a 10-movies recommendation.
